# DoubleEngine
My precious, if reading it code you don't understand what it does and it looks as pile of garbage for you.
Don't worry, you already need to be partially insane to write something like this alone.
This technology could possible:
- Already be used in some games
- Make process of creating games and generating worlds for them more easy
- Add destructable elements to games and partial physics (this require coworking with read game engine developers)

## Why I did not shared it earlier, even that I need help in developing it?
I do not wan't it to die, like many such projects did (and this will probably ends the same).
I know better, in this case I sure of it.
But the biggest problem always was is my scare that somebody takes it away.
But releasing this is really right way to do, especially if I go mad so badly that won't be able to work over computer.
However, I don't want it to be just taken away so:
